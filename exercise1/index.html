	<strong>Tell</strong> me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">your <em>peace.</a> </em> <br>
Let it tell your story now<br>
Of trials and tribulations, a tale <em>not of dreams</em><br>
Weary from a journey of self-discovery<br>
My child, know the comfort in your peace<br>
You feel hope in this familiar place <br>
As it gently sloughs the pain away <br>
Tell me of your peace <br>
In which we all are blessed and free<br>
Search throughout your soul sweet child<br>
Peer not within your cluttered mind <br>
Look out to rest your tired eyes but do not let them see<br>
Solace found strewn upon daily thoughts is fleeting at it's best<br>
Lasting merely moments, in untouched souls a true peace <br>
Oh yes! You'll know when you arrive but only you will know <br>
The world will melt away as a candle left under the blazing sun<br>
Away away, until you feel home again, an unguided familiar scene<br>
An innocence once lost is restored, all sins suddenly forgiven<br>
Soaking this in with relucant ease, <br>
Breathe it deep with a slow release<br>
Take it in, delight in details you discover<br>
Be calm here child, please have no fear, I am here <br>
You are safe in this place of yours, no hurt no tears<br>
We share not the same peace, no no<br>
Unique to each of us, yet stranger to none<br>
Trust in more than what you see, know beauty is within reach<br>
We share this unspoken bond of freedom from ourselves<br>
Please young one, listen closer now <br>
I say, leave it all behind you love, it will only weigh you down<br>
Cleanse yourself of careless words and careful lies <br>
I know you're weary, let go of all you carry<br>
Don't be afraid, here you are burden free <br>
Trust in you, blessed one, it's easier than you believe<br>
Sweet child, tell me now if you see<br>
Peace resting deep within <br>
Waiting for you<br>
For you to let it be<br>
