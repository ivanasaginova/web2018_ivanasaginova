<p>1. While reading this, I thought about how important it is to make multiple iterations of your work before you come to a final conclusion. I find it can be easy to create one version of something, be decently satisfied, and want to move on to the next. But it's very interesting to see how many different outcomes you can come up with by trying to view one thing from different perspectives. </p>
<p>2. After reading just 6 version of the same text I was already very annoyed, it blows my mind that there is a a whole book of even more iterations of it. Although, I do appreciate the example it makes of my point above.</p>
