        <p><i>Photos by Ivana Saginova ~~ Taken in Iceland (September 2018) </i><br><br>
            Ivana is an artist and designer based in New York City. She currently attends Parsons School of Design in the Integrated Design program with minors in communication design and printmaking. Ivana picked up film photography earlier this year while traveling with a desire to better capture her experiences. While this isn’t something she takes as seriously as her studies, it’s still something she enjoys and looks forward to! With recent travels around the states and to Bulgaria and Iceland, she likes the opportunity to get away from the digital craze of taking a million photos on an iPhone to actually enjoy and appreciate what the world has to offer. </p>
